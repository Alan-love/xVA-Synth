    "1.0.0": "Initial release",
    "1.0.1": "Added updates menu",
    "1.0.2": "Fixed some issues causing infinite loading screens",
    "1.0.3": "- Improved the UI - reorganized the buttons to group the letter-specific tasks to the top bar, and sequence-wide setting on the bottom bar\n- Added a 'Reset letter' button\n- Made it more clear which letter is being edited by highlighting it in red\n- Added an option in the settings for auto-playing the audio when it's generated\n- Fixed an issue where question marks in the input broke file saving",
    "1.0.4": "Bug fixes",
    "1.0.5": "Bug fixes",
    "1.0.6": "- Added a file logger for the front-end to aid with user support/debugging - app.log\n- Fixed audio not saving if filename-unsafe characters are in the input sequence\n- Reduced freedom of range on the pitch slider to reduce bad quality output\n- Fixed issue with auto-regen spamming the model with every slider tick and filling the screen with modals (all crashing if also making the app run out of vram)\n- Fixed issue with deleting newly generated files\n- Other small tweaks and fixes",
    "1.0.7": "- Made the amplify/flatten buttons additive instead of multiplicative (to avoid it getting out of hand)\n- Fixed the letter length/pacing sliders! (I could never reproduce the issue, but I'd be surprised if this didn't fix it)\n- Fixed a few small path issues, potentially also fixing a bug where temporary files were not getting cleaned\n- Small UI changes, including file record hover effect, and including the file name in the deletion prompt\n- Fixed newline characters in the prompt breaking file saving\n- Added the ability to specify (on a per-game basis) what directory the output files should be placed in, when saved",
    "1.0.8": "- Changed the default window size (you can always resize this by dragging the corner) and enlarged settings menu\n- Fixed bad default custom filepaths in settings that may have lead to some audio output issues (you will still need to adjust this if you've already loaded v1.0.7, as those values are now bound to your personal settings - remove the double 'resources/app' if you have that - just check that the path exists)",
    "1.0.9": "- Added audio post-processing (via ffmpeg, you need to install it to enable this), to allow audio settings such as: file format, silence padding, sampling rate, and bit depth\n- Bug fixes for the pitch/length editor, for when the input is changed (then 'Something went wrong' happens)\n- Reduced the rate of increase/decrease of the Amplify/Flatten buttons",
    "1.1.0": "- Ability to edit previously generated samples* Numerical inputs for sliders\n- Upgraded WaveGlow to a better version. Bigger and a bit slower, but better sounding output across the board\n- Re-implemented a big part of the letter lengths mechanism, fixing many issues in the process\n- Ability to edit multiple letters at once (ctrl+click multiple), moving pitch slider together as a group\n- Compiled using CUDA 11.0 (fix for 3000 series GPUs)\n- Shift-click 'Keep sample' to first bring up a file name prompt\n- Stopped disabling the 'Keep sample' button (useful for when outputting several audio post-processing versions)\n- Made clicking on the letter bring focus to it (instead of clicking the slider and accidentally changing its value)\n- Made the pitch editor taller\n- Show the values for the editor sliders in a local tooltip\n- Fixed bug with renaming files with explicit file format in the name\n- Fix mp3 audio post-processing output sometimes failing\n- Fixes to file re-naming if full stops were present in the input sequence\n- Several other internal changes, including tweaks for any potential memory leaks\n- Keyboard shortcuts, with a new 'Information' menu, containing this cheat sheet:\n left/right arrows: Move between letter focused\n SHIFT-left/right: multi-letter create selection range\n up/down move pitch up/down for the letter(s) selected\n CTRL+left/right arrows change the sequence-wide pacing\n CTRL+up/down increase/decrease buttons\n CTRL+SHIFT-up/down amplify/flatten buttons\n space bring focus to the input textarea\n Enter: Generate sample\n CTRL-S: Keep sample\n CTRL-SHIFT-S: Keep sample (but with rename prompt)\n Escape: close modals\n Y/N for prompt modals",
    "1.1.1": "- Various bug fixes on v1.1 features from feedback on the beta version\n- Added letter length support to the multi-letter editing mode\n- Enlarged the changelog/updates menu to fit the complete changelogs\n- Made amp/flat incr/decr buttons work only on selected range when multiple letters are selected\n- Fixed an issue with Amplify/flatten, increase/decrease buttons starting to overreact after the app has been in use for some time\n- Fixed issues with sluggishness of the app after some time of use has passed",
    "1.2.0": "- Added support for bespoke voice vocoder models - a fourth file in voice packs, a HiFi GAN model trained specifically for that voice with higher quality than either WaveGlow vocoders, at the speed of the 'quick-and-dirty' model. Denoted by a 'ðŸ—²'' symbol next to the dropdown where available (To start with just F4: Nate)\n- Added support for models saved as FP16, meaning models from now on will only be half as big (in terms of file size)\n- Added an option to select which Vocoder you prefer to use (following feedback on v1.1 vocoder model change) - useful for deciding which to use for the best quality\n- Added an amplitude multiplier ffmpeg audio post-processing option\n- Added a search bar for the models selection panel\n- Fixed issue where keyboard shortcuts were active when typing in input fields\n- Added a specific error message to when the output directory for saving audio files does not exist\n- UI tweaks/changes, enlarged minimum size of modals, for extremely small window sizes (the window can be resized)\n- Fixed some occasional issues with file re-naming (and then editing)\n- Made the 'Enter' key act as a submit action when in the rename modal (and other prompt modals)",
    "1.2.1": "- Fixed reset button not resetting pacing, and the 'Reset Letter' doing it (swapped)\n- Fixed voice-specific sub-folders not being automatically created in the output directory"
